= Client Contract: Hawking Toolbar =
=== General Description: ===
The Hawking Toolbar Project's goal is to design a firefox plugin which will enable users to navigate websites using a limited interface. This will allow users with disabilities to interact with a simple interface customized to best suit their abilities. This project hopes to achieve a plugin with two styles: a basic, limited interface for literacy teaching to people with disabilities, and a robust toolbar which will allow interfacing not only with the website, but also the browser history, (back, forward, and refresh). The plugin should not only recognize links <a href> tags but also form buttons and any object on the page with javascript onClick event capturing. The selection of links should be easily recognizable and customizable to the abilities of the end user.
