#Description of the manuals we will be creating for the Hawking Toolbar

==Developer Manual==
This manual will describe the architecture of the Hawking Toolbar as well as how to implement new subtoolbar extensions for Hawking. Some other info may include firefox documentation and tricks, etc.

==Administrative Manual==
This manual will detail installation and configuration of the toolbar as well as explain the entire feature set and all visible components to an administrator of the toolbar. An administrator is a person who is setting up the toolbar for other users and changing preferences. Will cover Move and Engage as well as relevant architecture needs?

==Literacy Center Admin==
This Manual should either extend or be a separate addition to the Administrative manual that will describe how to use literacy mode...most likely it can just be an addition to the other manuals. 

==User Manual==
Manual will explain how to use the toolbar for a disabled user. This will explain the Move and Engage idea as well as specifics on how to navigate the web.
