#summary Functional Specification of Hawking Toolbar

==Primary Functions and Objectives==
  * Provide a simple, limited-input navigation mechanism between linked web pages based on document hyperlinks
  * Provide a simple, limited-input mechanism for viewing all the content on web pages

==General Design Principles==
  * Creation of two types of toolbars:
    *A simple toolbar for highly disabled users that navigates proprietary fixed size pages based on two input keys
    * An advanced toolbar that has added functionality to allow navigation of normal Internet pages based on 1-3 input keys
  * Visually accessible highlighting and selection of hyperlinks on screen
  * Easily accessible mechanism for walking through all the hyperlinks of a web document
  * Simple mechanism for selecting a highlighted link to navigate to.
  * Toggle mechanism for activating the stepping through links mechanism during a page visit.
  * Create a way for advanced toolbar users to scroll through the document and read it even if there are no hyperlinks.
  * Create a mechanism for discovering and displaying Cascading Style Sheet hyperlinks and hidden visibility hyperlinks to display to the user.
  * Create a trapping function which will disallow clicking links which take you out of the current domain as a trapping feature
  * There should be a preferences and settings menu from which a non-disabled user can customize the toolbar to fit the individual needs of the disabled user. The preferences and settings menu should allow the customization of:
    * Hyperlink highlighting (visual nature of how the link will be displayed)
    * Whether or not the links are automatically stepped through when the page is loaded
    * Customizing the input keys corresponding to all actions needed to navigate or view a page.
    * Stepping speed of hyperlink selection (how fast it goes to the next link)
    * Overall should really be focused on trying to customize the toolbar for anyoneâ€™s reaction and or usage abilities
  * An intuitive design, user interface, and input mechanism

==Requirements (prioritized)==
  # Logical Usage method as defined by disabled users
  # Functionality with limited input (1-3 keys)
  # Simple, intuitive interface

==User Types==
  * Highly Disabled 
  * Disabled
  * Administrator

==Use Cases==
User
  # Auto Iteration of Hyperlinks
  # Manual Iteration of Hyperlinks
  # Selection of Hyperlink
  # Page Scrolling
  # Toggling between Manual and Auto Iteration Mode

Administrator
  # Activate or Deactivate the toolbar
  # Turn off auto-iteration
  # Change the Link Appearance
  # Map keys to toolbar/navigation actions
  # Change the auto iteration speed

==Use Case Details==
_These use case details describe the functionality of the toolbar_

*U1: Auto Iteration of Hyperlinks*
  Auto Iteration of Hyperlinks will step through the links of a page and highlite them for the user. A timing setting will be important here to be customized by the administrator so that it matches the user's reaction time needs. Auto Iteration will do this without any input from the user.

*U2: Manual Iteration of Hyperlinks*
  Manual Iteration or manual stepping of hyperlinks allows the user to provide input via a control switch mapped to a keyboard key that will highlight each member of an Enumeration of all the links of a page in order.

*U3: Selection of Hyperlink*
  Once a user highlights a hyperlink using auto or manual iteration, the use of a control switch shall allow them to select this hyperlink as if they clicked on it with a mouse in order to navigate to that page.

*U4: Page Scrolling*
  Page scrolling allows the user to scroll down a page without Hyperlinks using one or more control switches. If the user has only one control switch, then page scrolling will scroll a defined screen width each time until the bottom is reached, at which time the next press of the switch returns them to the top of the page. Users with two switches may pick up the added functionality of scrolling up and down with the switches.

U5: Pausing Auto Iteration Mode
  There will be functionality that allows the user to pause the auto iteration of links. This allows the user to stop iterating through links and view the content of the page. When the user wants to resume, some input mechanism will unpause the iteration.
