#summary Functional Specification of Hawking Toolbar

==Primary Functions and Objectives==
  * Provide a simple, limited-input navigation mechanism between linked web pages based on document hyperlinks
  * Provide a simple, limited-input mechanism for viewing all the content on web pages

==General Design Principles==
  * Creation of two types of toolbars:
    *A simple toolbar for highly disabled users that navigates proprietary fixed size pages based on two input keys
    * An advanced toolbar that has added functionality to allow navigation of normal Internet pages based on 1-3 input keys
  * Visually accessible highlighting and selection of hyperlinks on screen
  * Easily accessible mechanism for walking through all the hyperlinks of a web document
  * Simple mechanism for selecting a highlighted link to navigate to.
  * Toggle mechanism for activating the stepping through links mechanism during a page visit.
  * Create a way for advanced toolbar users to scroll through the document and read it even if there are no hyperlinks.
  * Create a mechanism for discovering and displaying Cascading Style Sheet hyperlinks and hidden visibility hyperlinks to display to the user.
  * Create a trapping function which will disallow clicking links which take you out of the current domain as a trapping feature
  * There should be a preferences and settings menu from which a non-disabled user can customize the toolbar to fit the individual needs of the disabled user. The preferences and settings menu should allow the customization of:
    * Hyperlink highlighting (visual nature of how the link will be displayed)
    * Whether or not the links are automatically stepped through when the page is loaded
    * Customizing the input keys corresponding to all actions needed to navigate or view a page.
    * Stepping speed of hyperlink selection (how fast it goes to the next link)
    * Overall should really be focused on trying to customize the toolbar for anyoneâ€™s reaction and or usage abilities
  * An intuitive design, user interface, and input mechanism

==Requirements (prioritized)==
  # Logical Usage method as defined by disabled users
  # Functionality with limited input (1-3 keys)
  # Simple, intuitive interface
